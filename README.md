## Key DAX Measures

```dax
-- Month-over-month revenue growth using date arithmetic
Revenue MoM % =
VAR CurrentDate = SELECTEDVALUE(monthly_revenue[month])
VAR CurYear     = YEAR(CurrentDate)
VAR CurMonth    = MONTH(CurrentDate)
VAR PrevDate    = DATE(IF(CurMonth=1, CurYear-1, CurYear), IF(CurMonth=1, 12, CurMonth-1), 1)
VAR PriorRev    = CALCULATE(SUM(monthly_revenue[revenue_eur]), monthly_revenue[month] = PrevDate)
RETURN DIVIDE(SUM(monthly_revenue[revenue_eur]) - PriorRev, PriorRev) * 100

-- Year-over-year comparison
Revenue YoY % =
VAR RevCurrent = CALCULATE(SUM(monthly_revenue[revenue_eur]), monthly_revenue[year] = 2024)
VAR RevPrior   = CALCULATE(SUM(monthly_revenue[revenue_eur]), monthly_revenue[year] = 2023)
RETURN DIVIDE(RevCurrent - RevPrior, RevPrior) * 100
